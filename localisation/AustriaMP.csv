enact_triple_monarchy_desc;Trialism in Austria-Hungary was a movement started by the nobility of Austria-Hungary in the latter half of the 19th century to raise the South-Slavs to equal status as the Germans and Hungarians. The creation of a third crown will greatly increase stability in the Habsburg realm and lower tensions with Yugoslav nationalists. Although greatly opposed by the Hungarian part of the nation, these reforms are necessary to the realm's survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
