EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$.\n\n§RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time-- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory-- that is only in dispute by those neighbours who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbours-- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them-- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least-- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high-- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbours-- much as those neighbours might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2650;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them-- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2651;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation-- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95514;Ethiopian Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95514;Now that Imperial rule has been restored, we must endeavour to spread control over lands that neighbour our own but which are rightfully part of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95512;Zemene Mesafint;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-- and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

treaty_of_umtata_title;Treaty of Umtata;;;;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_umtata_desc;Now that the war with the Xhosa is done, the time has come to discuss our mutual borders. With our colonists increasingly moving eastward, we may need to incorporate some of their lands into the South African Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME19510;Stockenström's treaty system;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19510;The Sixth Xhosa War is over, but raids and counter-raids on the eastern frontier continue to lead to friction. At this rate, another large-scale Xhosa invasion seems inevitable. Andries Stockenström, governor of the Eastern Cape, claims he has a way to end these border conflicts once and for all. Stockenström believes our recent expansion into Xhosa territory will exacerbate their overpopulation issues and lead to further conflicts on the frontier. His controversial proposal is that we return some of the taken lands, formalise the border and work with local chiefs to punish cattle raiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME19500;The Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19500;The British occupation is something most Afrikaners would prefer to forget about. With the British spread thin across the world, our settlers were mostly left to their own devices defending from the Bantu invaders. By the end of the Fifth Xhosa War of 1819, most of South Africa was controlled by Boer governorates and their provincial militias. Crippled by debt, the British government gave up their hold on Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and confirmed South African independence in exchange for a small sum of money and fleet basing rights. Rumours of gold, diamonds, and unlimited riches have led many to flee war-torn Europe for our republic. Some Boers have even decided to migrate further inland. On the other hand, overcrowding in Xhosa lands has culminated in yet another Frontier War-- the largest Bantu incursion into Afrikaner territory yet. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA19500;The only way is forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME19511;Zulu-Xhosa Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19511;The Xhosa have been slowly creeping into our lands ever since they were defeated by the white men. Some Zulu chieftains have already decided to take matters into their own hands, severely punishing cattle raiders and other good-for-nothings. Perhaps now is the time to escalate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA19511;They will tremble before our might!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB19511;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98261;Expanding North;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98261;Many Boer settlers are pushing north of the Cape into areas not yet controlled by the central government. We should consider establishing greater control over their settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrating_transvaal_title;Integrating Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrating_transvaal_desc;The Transvaal colony has been under control of Boer settlers for a while now. The time has come to formally integrate the region into the South African nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrating_natal_title;Integrating Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrating_natal_desc;The Natal colony has been under control of Boer settlers for a while now. The time has come to formally integrate the region into the South African nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98220;The Northern Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98220;Some Boers have been trekking north from the Cape into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Transvaal and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98206;The Voortrekker encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Gerrit Maritz and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether we will leave them in charge or control it directly from Kaapstad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98207;The Natal Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98207;The Voortrekkers who moved eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for a new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new republic to be under local rule or under ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the eastern frontier that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and our settlers. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the republic believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98255;Stockenströms treaty system kept the peace for some time. Those times are over. Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence on the eastern border. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of Boer farms. Our settlers are demanding that we take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98257;Dealing with the Basotho Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98257;We never had any issues with the Sotho people, despite the existence of several Boer settlements within their kingdom. On the other hand, our border was never formalised either. Expansionist voices are calling for us to use this to our advantage by announcing a claim on Sotho lands with Boer settlements. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a group of Boers that entered their territory in search of new places to settle. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME27500;Dutch Indonesia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC27500;$COUNTRY$ has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and it would be in our best interests to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region. Many within our government feel that if the Netherlands is to remain a power to be reckoned with, it must expand its colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

integrating_philippines_desc;We were victorious in the Philippine War, and the annexation of the Philippine islands to $COUNTRY$ is our reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
